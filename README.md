Etrian Odyssey Nexus Skill Respec Tool
======================================

This is a simple JavaFX gui tool for redistributing skill points on characters
in an Etrian Odyssey Nexus savefile without needing to rest them. It also
includes functionality for syncing exp and levels as well as providing
retirement bonuses without resetting level, as well as for changing the
characters' subclasses and saving and loading skill point distributions. It does
not, at base, provide any cheat-type functionality (such as adding extra skill
points beyond what a character should be able to have).

Descriptions and numeric data for skill info pop-ups was scraped from
[this guide](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/3ds/236401-etrian-odyssey-nexus/faqs/76142),

itself is placed under the GPLv3.
